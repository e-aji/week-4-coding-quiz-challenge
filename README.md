# week-4-coding-quiz-challenge

## Description 

The aim of this project is to create a timed quiz that will take the user through all the questions included in the quiz, display each question at one time, subtracts time from the clock when a question is answered incorrectly and when either the timer reaches 0 or all the questions have been answered. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Usage 

* When the start button is clicked, the user can bagin answering questions 

* If a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock 

* When all the Questions have been answered and/or the timer has reached 0, the user is then shown their score and asked to enter their initials. 

* The user then has the option to save their initials and score 

* The user can also be directed to the high scores page to see where they rank 

* Once on the high score page, the user is able to select either 'restart' or 'clear' to restart the game or clear the high score page.
