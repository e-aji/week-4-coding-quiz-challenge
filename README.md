# week-4-coding-quiz-challenge

## Description 

The aim of this project is to create a timed quiz that will take the user through all the questions included in the quiz, display each question at one time, subtracts time from the clock when a question is answered incorrectly and when either the timer reaches 0 or all the questions have been answered. 

## User Story
